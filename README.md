# Machine-Learning
Projects on machine learning.  Specifically, convolutional neural networks and image recognition.  
```onnx_read.py```, ```onnx_split.py```, and ```onnx_random.py``` created by Daniel Wen for use by Expedera, Inc.

# Sample Models
The folder `sample-models` contains ONNX models that ```onnx_read.py``` and ```onnx_split.py``` can be used on if you have no ONNX models to use them on.  
You can also visualize them on on Netron.  
Files ending in "_randomized_model.onnx" are sample models created by ```onnx_random.py```.
